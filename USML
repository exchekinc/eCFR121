This paragraph does not control explosives, propellants, pyrotechnics, fuels, oxidizers, binders, additives, or precursors therefor (a) in production, (b) determined to be subject to the EAR via a commodity jurisdiction determination, or (c) identified in the relevant Department of Defense contract or other funding authorization as being developed for both civil and military applications.

Note 2 to paragraph (i):

Note 1 does not apply to defense articles enumerated on the U.S. Munitions List, whether in production or development.

Note 3 to paragraph (i):

This paragraph is applicable only to those contracts and funding authorizations that are dated January 5, 2015, or later.

(j) Technical data (see § 120.33 of this subchapter) and defense services (see § 120.32 of this subchapter) directly related to the defense articles described in paragraphs (a) through (i) of this category (see also § 120.5(c) of this subchapter for nuclear related controls) (MT for articles designated as such).

(k) The following interpretations explain and amplify the terms used in this category and elsewhere in this subchapter:

(1) USML Category V contains explosives, energetic materials, propellants, and pyrotechnics and specially formulated fuels for aircraft, missile, and naval applications. Explosives are solid, liquid, or gaseous substances or mixtures of substances, which, in their primary, booster, or main charges in warheads, demolition, or other military applications, are required to detonate.

(2) The resulting product of the combination or conversion of any substance controlled by this category into an item not controlled will no longer be controlled by this category provided the controlled item cannot easily be recovered through dissolution, melting, sieving, etc. As an example, beryllium converted to a near net shape using hot isostatic processes will result in an uncontrolled part. A cured thermoset containing beryllium powder is not controlled unless meeting an explosive or propellant control. The mixture of beryllium powder in a cured thermoset shape is not controlled by this category. The mixture of controlled beryllium powder mixed with a typical propellant binder will remain controlled by this category. The addition of dry silica powder to dry beryllium powder will remain controlled.

(3) Paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this category does not apply to boron and boron carbide enriched with boron-10 (20% or more of total boron-10 content).

(4) Theoretical specific impulse (Isp) is calculated using standard conditions (1000 psi chamber pressure expanded to 14.7 psi) and measured in units of pound-force-seconds per pound-mass (lbf-s/lbm) or simplified to seconds (s). Calculations will be based on shifting equilibrium.

(5) Particle size is the mean particle diameter on a weight basis. Best industrial practices will be used in determining particle size and the controls may not be undermined by addition of larger or smaller sized material to shift the mean diameter.

(l)-(w) \[Reserved\]

(x) Commodities, software, and technical data subject to the EAR used in or with defense articles.

Note to paragraph (x):

Note 1 to paragraph (e)(17):

_Primary payload_ is that complement of equipment designed from the outset to accomplish the prime mission function of the spacecraft payload mission set. The primary payload may operate independently from the secondary payload(s). _Secondary payload_ is that complement of equipment designed from the outset to be fully integrated into the spacecraft payload mission set. The secondary payload may operate separately from the primary payload. _Hosted payload_ is a complement of equipment or sensors that uses the available or excess capacity (mass, volume, power, etc.) of a spacecraft to accommodate an additional, independent mission. The hosted payload may share the spacecraft bus support infrastructure. The hosted payload performs an additional, independent mission which does not dictate control or operation of the spacecraft. A hosted payload is not capable of operating as an independent spacecraft. _Spacecraft bus_ (distinct from the spacecraft payload), provides the support infrastructure of the spacecraft (e.g., command and data handling, communications and antenna(s), electrical power, propulsion, thermal control, attitude and orbit control, guidance, navigation and control, structure and truss, life support (for crewed mission)) and location (e.g., attachment, interface) for the spacecraft payload. _Spacecraft payload_ is that complement of equipment attached to the spacecraft bus that performs a particular mission in space (e.g., communications, observation, science).

Note 2 to paragraph (e)(17):

An ECCN 9A004 or ECCN 9A515.a spacecraft remains a spacecraft subject to the EAR even when incorporating a hosted payload performing a function described in paragraph (a) of this category. All spacecraft that incorporate primary or secondary payloads that perform a function described in paragraph (a) of this category are controlled by that paragraph. This paragraph does not control primary or secondary payloads of the James Webb Space Telescope, which are subject to the EAR.

\\* (18) Secondary or hosted payload, and specially designed parts and components therefor, developed with Department of Defense-funding;

Note 1 to paragraph (e)(18):

Note 3 to paragraph (f):

Paragraph (f) and ECCNs 9E001, 9E002 and 9E515 do not control the data transmitted to or from a satellite or spacecraft, whether real or simulated, when limited to information about the health, operational status, or measurements or function of, or raw sensor output from, the spacecraft, spacecraft payload(s), or its associated subsystems or components. Such information is not within the scope of information captured within the definition of technology in the EAR for purposes of Category 9 Product Group E. Examples of such information, which are commonly referred to as “housekeeping data,” include (i) system, hardware, component configuration, and operation status information pertaining to temperatures, pressures, power, currents, voltages, and battery charges; (ii) spacecraft or payload orientation or position information, such as state vector or ephemeris information; (iii) payload raw mission or science output, such as images, spectra, particle measurements, or field measurements; (iv) command responses; (v) accurate timing information; and (vi) link budget data. The act of processing such telemetry data— _i.e.,_ converting raw data into engineering units or readable products—or encrypting it does not, in and of itself, cause the telemetry data to become subject to the ITAR or to ECCN 9E515 for purposes of 9A515, or to ECCNs 9E001 or 9E002 for purposes of 9A004. All classified technical data directly related to items controlled in USML Category XV or ECCNs 9A515, and defense services using the classified technical data, remains subject to the ITAR. This note does not affect controls in USML XV(f), ECCN 9D515, or ECCN 9E515 on software source code or commands that control a spacecraft, payload, or associated subsystems for purposes of 9A515.

<P>(1) USML Category V contains explosives, energetic materials, propellants, and pyrotechnics and specially formulated fuels for aircraft, missile, and naval applications. Explosives are solid, liquid, or gaseous substances or mixtures of substances, which, in their primary, booster, or main charges in warheads, demolition, or other military applications, are required to detonate.</P>

<P>(2) The resulting product of the combination or conversion of any substance controlled by this category into an item not controlled will no longer be controlled by this category provided the controlled item cannot easily be recovered through dissolution, melting, sieving, etc. As an example, beryllium converted to a near net shape using hot isostatic processes will result in an uncontrolled part. A cured thermoset containing beryllium powder is not controlled unless meeting an explosive or propellant control. The mixture of beryllium powder in a cured thermoset shape is not controlled by this category. The mixture of controlled beryllium powder mixed with a typical propellant binder will remain controlled by this category. The addition of dry silica powder to dry beryllium powder will remain controlled.</P>

<P>(3) Paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this category does not apply to boron and boron carbide enriched with boron-10 (20% or more of total boron-10 content).</P>

<P>(4) Theoretical specific impulse (Isp) is calculated using standard conditions (1000 psi chamber pressure expanded to 14.7 psi) and measured in units of pound-force-seconds per pound-mass (lbf-s/lbm) or simplified to seconds (s). Calculations will be based on shifting equilibrium.</P>

<P>(5) Particle size is the mean particle diameter on a weight basis. Best industrial practices will be used in determining particle size and the controls may not be undermined by addition of larger or smaller sized material to shift the mean diameter.</P>

<P>“Range” is the maximum distance that the specified aircraft system is capable of traveling in the mode of stable flight as measured by the projection of its trajectory over the surface of the Earth. The maximum capability based on the design characteristics of the system, when fully loaded with fuel or propellant, will be taken into consideration in determining range. The range for aircraft systems will be determined independently of any external factors such as operational restrictions, limitations imposed by telemetry, data links, or other external constraints. For aircraft systems, the range will be determined for a one-way distance using the most fuel-efficient flight profile (e.g., cruise speed and altitude), assuming International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standard atmosphere with zero wind, but with no fuel reserve.</P>

</HED>

<P>

Paragraph (f) and ECCNs 9E001, 9E002 and 9E515 do not control the data transmitted to or from a satellite or spacecraft, whether real or simulated, when limited to information about the health, operational status, or measurements or function of, or raw sensor output from, the spacecraft, spacecraft payload(s), or its associated subsystems or components. Such information is not within the scope of information captured within the definition of technology in the EAR for purposes of Category 9 Product Group E. Examples of such information, which are commonly referred to as “housekeeping data,” include (i) system, hardware, component configuration, and operation status information pertaining to temperatures, pressures, power, currents, voltages, and battery charges; (ii) spacecraft or payload orientation or position information, such as state vector or ephemeris information; (iii) payload raw mission or science output, such as images, spectra, particle measurements, or field measurements; (iv) command responses; (v) accurate timing information; and (vi) link budget data. The act of processing such telemetry data—

<I>i.e.,</I>

converting raw data into engineering units or readable products—or encrypting it does not, in and of itself, cause the telemetry data to become subject to the ITAR or to ECCN 9E515 for purposes of 9A515, or to ECCNs 9E001 or 9E002 for purposes of 9A004. All classified technical data directly related to items controlled in USML Category XV or ECCNs 9A515, and defense services using the classified technical data, remains subject to the ITAR. This note does not affect controls in USML XV(f), ECCN 9D515, or ECCN 9E515 on software source code or commands that control a spacecraft, payload, or associated subsystems for purposes of 9A515. This note also does not affect controls in ECCNs 9D001, 9D002, 9E001, or 9E002 on software source code or commands that control a spacecraft, payload, or associated subsystems for purposes of 9A004.
